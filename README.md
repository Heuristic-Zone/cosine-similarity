## Cosine similarity

- Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. The cosine of 0° is 1, and it is less than 1 for any angle in the interval (0,π] radians.


- `sentence1 = "This is a nice car"`
- `sentence2 = "The vehicle is better than the car"`


we will pass the content of each string into the build_sentence_vector function.

- `build_sentence_vector(sentence1, sentence2)` converts string passed into it and generate a vector.

- `cosineSimilarity(v1, v2)` takes in 2 vector and print out the similarity between the 2 vectors.
